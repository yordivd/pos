Just a test repo to mess around with creating a woocommerce pos. :)

## TODO
- [x] Basic store page with inertia
- [x] Filter products with inertia
- [x] WooCommerce REST API V3 connection
- [x] Make product repositories that create product entities
- [x] ~~Implement caching layer for product repository~~ Import products into elasticsearch
- [ ] Add products to cart functionality

## Issues
- WooCommerce REST API V3 does not allow fetching product variations without product ID. 
  Using this api is not a viable solution to build a POS system at this moment. 
  Waiting for update or better API.
